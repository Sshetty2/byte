Byte Academy 

This repository is a collection of projects, assignments, and  tasks that were used to help with my studies at Byte academy. The assignments and projects are loosely separated by week up to week 8. Some notable submissions include various Pandas/Numpy exercises from week 2, a trading application that operates from in terminal only built with python in Week 3, and A calculator app built with flask in Week 6.

Several other projects were taken out of this repository to be separated out independently.
