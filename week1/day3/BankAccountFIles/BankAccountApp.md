# Bank Account App

The bank account app written with Python is a prompt-based command-line application that allows the user to create a bank account that will include an automatically generated credit card that is generated authentically using the Luhn Algorithm. 

The user will be able to log in and make transfers to other bank accounts if they have been created.
